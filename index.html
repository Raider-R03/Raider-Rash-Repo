  <p> The view of west texas is very nice when you get a few miles out of lubbock. The canyons outside of town are amazing if you have the ablity to power through the cotton fields and cattle heards</p>

  <p> So for context I am in the great state of new york, we have a chain of supermakrets called tops. Idk if its just a buffalo thing or a whole of new york thing but I think they are neat. I saw this drawn at the wall of our local tops, I had to explain who/what hatsune miku is to my 74 year old papa. </p>
  <p> Speaking of buffalo I will say right now I am a huge tech fan being a student in all, but I gotta say I fucking love the bills. Josh allen will forever be our golden boy and the win against miami keeps us at the top of the afc east</p>
